Keen's developers are high, and I keep forgetting which is which, so:
* stator.SetValueFloat("LowerLimit", float) and stator.SetValueFloat("UpperLimit", float) take degree units
* stator.UpperLimit and stator.LowerLimit getters return radians
* stator.UpperLimit and stator.LowerLimit setters do not work yet [TODO for next major update]
* stator.TargetVelocity getters return RPM
* stator.TargetVelocity setters take radians per second

To make setup easier, clamping will be relative to the offset. This will allow users to copy and past configurations
between different stators even if their offsets are different (they will have to adjust the offset to match the
physical offset of the stator).

TODOs for next major update (major API changes):
* Implement UpperLimit and LowerLimit setters
* Check if setters and getters are resolved to a common unit
