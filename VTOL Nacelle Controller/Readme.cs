 * NOTE: If you change the reference rotor's name, it will not immediately update
 * in the programmable block's info panel. Run the block with the "update" argument,
 * recompile the script, or reload the world to update a reference rotor's name.
 * (Mismatched names have no effect on the script other than the wrong name being
 * displayed in the info panel.)
